				...Fl-Calendar is a free online Web-App :
				<a href="http://www.flash-line.org/app/web/html5/calendar/en.html"target="_blank"> </a>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				It is open- source. Can be downloaded / forked :
				<a href="https://github.com/flashline/FL-Calendar" target="_self"> on github </a>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				This is the HTML5 version of a Flash web-app :
				<a href="http://www.flash-line.org/app/web/calendar/" www.flash-line.org/app/web/calendar/ target="_blank"> </a>
				<br/>
				Flash version only works on desktop computers.
				<br/>
				<strong> You can use currently both versions because they target the same database. </strong>
				<br/>

				The first idea is to display full year (from december year-1 to January year+1) on one screen,
				to provide quick access to months and days .
				<br/>
				So many months and days as desired can be opened at the same time and texts can be dragAndDroped.
				<br/>
				Simple calendar if you aren't logged in, app. becomes an agenda/schedule by logging.
				<br/>
				A note can be associated with a day of the month and/or the entire month.
				<br/>
				The same URL works as well on mobiles than PC/Mac.
				<br/>
				Layout adapts it-self to any kind of screens or browser's ratios.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				This app is designed to run on a valid HTML5 browser.
				<br/>
				Tested by me on :
				<div>
				<div>
				recent versions of Chrome , Firefox and Safari browsers, <br/>
				IE mobile v10 , <br/>
				Android: native &amp; Firefox browsers, Htc smartphone and Acer tablet.
				</div>
				<br/>
				(!) Gradients aren't okay on Safari and native Android browser.

			<p>
				I use this calendar myself and backup regularly datas. But if you want to do it yourself, it is better to download and install the application
				on your web server.
				<br/>
				Sql database isn't necessary, but PHP is required.
				<br/>

				<br/><br/>
				Do not hesitate to leave me encouragement and let me know bugs. I will correct them as soon as possible
				(tell me where error occures: Mobile, PC or Mac and the browser's name) :

				<strong> If this application please to you , talk about it around you :) </strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				English is not my mother language as you can see... As Droopy says, I'd be an happy taxpayer, 
				if a real english speaking corrects this documentation for me :)
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Recommendations:
				<div><div>
					Orientation "portrait" is better on smartphones and tablets.
				<br/>
				On a large width tablet in landscape-mode, the layout is the same as PC/Mac. But the portrait-mode 
				seems still preferable to me.
				<br/>
				FL -Calendar is very simple and intuitive to use, but
				<br/>
				<strong> it is advisable to read at least  bold texts of user-guide below. </strong>

				On 1st launch (when no session is open)

					<strong> Click on "Cancel" : </strong>
					<div>
						The window will disappear and you can just:
						<br/>

				Registration allows you to create your own schedule or agenda, to enter notes for a day or a month.
				<br/>
				To register:
				<br/>
				Click on "SignIn/signUp".
				<div> a dialog-box appears, go to lower part.
					<div> Enter a name :
					<div>
					This name must be unique. If it is already taken by another user , an error message appears and you must select another one.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<strong> Its length must be from 3 to 10 characters. <br/>
					It must contain only letters A to Z and numbers from 0 to 9.
					</strong>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					This may be a pseudonym, your name or the name of the calendar if you like to create many of them.
					</div>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<div>
					Enter a password:
					<div>
					<strong> Its length must be from 6 to 10 characters . </strong>
					</div>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<div>
					Confirm password:
					<div>
					If  passwords are different an error message appears.
					</div>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<div>
					Click on bottom button "OK" .
					<div>
					Your personal calendar is created !
					<br/>
					A last dialog box offers you to send your email to receive updates and news from my other applications.
					<br/>
					You can leave this field blank and confirm.
					<br/>
					Otherwise : <br/>
					This email will never be disclosed and it is not stored on the Internet.
					<br/>
					</div>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<div>
						<strong> Notes: </strong>
						<div>
							Confidentiality is highly respected :
							<div>
									<br/>
									Emails are stored on a private server that I physically control. 
									They aren't related to texts (or nothing else !).
									<br/>
									Names and passwords are not stored in plaintext but coded ; <br/>
									There is no way (including for me) to link a text to a name because
									impossible to find a name from its code. <br/>
									(as explained below, the contrary  is fortunately possible). <br/>
									<br/>
									The counterpart is that you must remember  <strong> at least the name that you created. </Strong > <br/>
									If you lose password, I can with your name, retrieve the data and give you access to it.

					2_ Changing the current year:

							You can always go on the year of your choice without data loss. <br>
							<br/>
							<strong> Year is saved and  will be current year of next connection. </strong> <br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Notes: 
							<br/>
							If you close a calendar (log out) then create immediatly a new one (sign up) : it will have the same default year than the closed calendar. <br>		
							If you create a new calendar after page refreshing  : it will have the system year as default year. <br>

					<div>
						In case of "time-out" (see above) after click "enter": the last entry is retrieved.
